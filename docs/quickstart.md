Let's start from a simple case, just to get familiar with RocketJump. Basically, RocketJump provides just a function able to generate actions, reducers, selectors and sagas for a given API. 

Now we are going to apply this function on a real case. Suppose we are developing a simple Todo app, and we want to fetch some ToDos from an asynchronous REST API. This requires just a plain GET request, which is, unsurprisigly, asynchronous! We can code the API call with a simple asynchronous function returning a Promise:

```js
function loadTodosFromApi(params) {
  let myHeaders = new Headers();

  let config = { 
    method: 'GET',
    headers: new Headers(),
    body: params
  };

  return fetch('https://myawesomehost/api/posts', config)
    .then(response => response.json())
}
```

Ok, now we are ready to integrate our `loadTodosFromApi` asynchronous operation with Redux data flow. In order to do this, we need to generate
- some actions to handle the following events
  - make the request
  - request completes with success
  - request completes with error
- a reducer to manage these actions and update the state in a consisten way
- some selectors to extract data from the state
- a saga to wire all it up

Redux-RocketJump can provide all these elements out of the box!
This is all we need
- a name for the asynchronous task (it **must** be unique throughout your application)
- a path that describes where to store data in the redux store
- the asynchronous task we created before

This parameters must be passed in to RocketJump as a plain JavaScript object, like

```js
{
  type: 'GET_TODOS',                        // The name of the task
  state: 'todos',                           // The path to store data at
  effect: params => loadTodosFromApi(params)   // The asynchrous task
}
```

What we get is an object containing action dispatchers, reducer, selectors and saga. The keys of this object are the following
- **actions**: contains the actions dispatchers
  - **load**: dispatches the action that starts the asynchronous task
  - **unload**: dispatches an action to stop the asychronous task before it completes and to clear the state
- **reducer**: contains the reducer that manages data related to this task, i.e. the output, the errors and the state of our request
- **saga**: contains the saga that manages the side effects of the call
- **selectors**: contains selectors to access data regarding this task
  - **isLoading**: retrieves the loading state of the application (`true` if the task is pending, `false` otherwise)
  - **getData**: retrieves the data returned from the call when it completes with success
  - **getError**: retrieves the error returned from the call when it completes, if any

Now, let's put all these things together

This is our state/todos.js file

```jsx
// Import rocketjump (rj for friends) 
import { rj } from 'redux-rocketjump'
// Main export
// Here we deal with actions, reducers, selectors and sagas that have been created for us
export const {
  // Actions generated by rj
  actions: {
    // This is the function that triggers the side effect
    load: loadTodos,
    // This function stops the asynchronous task started with `load` and clears the state
    unload: unloadTods,
  },
  // Selectors generated by rj
  selectors: {
    // Selector used to get the value returned by the asynchronous task, when ready
    getData: getTodos,
    // Selector used to detect if the asynchronous task is running (i.e. the API call is loading)
    isLoading: isLoading,
    // Selector used to get the error with which the last API call failed (if available)
    getError: getTodsError,
  },
  // The generated reducer
  reducer,
  // The generated saga
  saga,
} = rj({
  type: 'GET_TODOS',
  state 'todos',
  effect: params => loadTodosFromApi(params),
})()
```

> Please note that the rj function returns another function! We have to invoke this second function to get the actual generated items.
> The reasons of this necessity will be clarified in the API chapter


And this is our root state file (state/index.js)
```js
import { createStore, compose, applyMiddleware, combineReducers } from 'redux'
import createSagaMiddleware from 'redux-saga'
import { makeAppsReducers, makeAppsSaga } from 'redux-rocketjump'
import * as todos from './todos'

// Merge all our application parts
const APPS = {
  todos
}

// Create root reducer
const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  ...makeAppsReducers(APPS),
})

// Create main saga
const mainSaga = makeAppsSaga(APPS)

// Initialize redux store
const preloadedState = undefined
const sagaMiddleware = createSagaMiddleware()
const store = createStore(
  rootReducer,
  preloadedState,
  compose(
    applyMiddleware(sagaMiddleware),
  )
)

// Start main saga
sagaMiddleware.run(mainSaga)

// Export the created store
export default store
```

Congratulations, you have set up your first RocketJump with success!
