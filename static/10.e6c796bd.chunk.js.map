Asynchronous tasks, moreover, can become quite cumbersome to manage. Let's think, for instance, to an application requiring some instantaneous search, i.e. a search feature that reacts to every keypress coming from the user.

The typical Redux code organization is to group code files by role: actions, reducers, sagas and selectors regarding the same data live in different folders, mixed up with code playing their same role but dealing with completely different data items.
