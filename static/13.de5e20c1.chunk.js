These properties **must** be defined in the last configuration object supplied to the definition of the `RocketJump Partial` you are invoking.\r\n\r\nExample\r\n```code\r\nlang: js\r\n---\r\nconst myRocketJumpPartial = rj(\r\n    rjPlugin1,\r\n    rjPlugin2,\r\n    {\r\n        /* other optional properties */\r\n\r\n        /* ----- THIS IS THE IMPORTANT PART ----- */\r\n        type: 'COOL_API_TYPE',\r\n        api: myAsyncFunction,\r\n        state: 'soCool'\r\n    }\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Configuration settings\r\n## type *(string)*\r\nThis key configures the name of the asynchronous task you are going to generate. It is **mandatory** that this name is unique throughout your application, in order to avoid name clashes. The value of this key is used as a prefix to create action types that will be used in the saga to tame asynchronism:\r\n- `${type}_LOADING` is dispatched when the asynchronous operation starts\r\n- `${type}_SUCCESS` is dispatched when the asynchronous operation completes successfully\r\n- `${type}_FAILURE` is dispatched when the asynchronous operation completes with some error\r\n- `${type}_UNLOAD` is dispatched when the asynchronous operation is stopped and the state cleared\r\n\r\n## state *(string|selector|function|false)*\r\nThis key configures the base selector used to access data managed by this rocketJump instance.\r\nIt can be a string, a selector from [reselect](https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect) or a function.\r\n\r\nIf it is a string, it is used like a path to access the state object using [lodash.get](https://lodash.com/docs/#get).\r\nIf it is a selector, it will be used as a base selector to create nested selectors.\r\nIf it is a function, it will be called with the redux store as its first argument.\r\n\r\nIf it is `false`, both selectors and reducer creation is skipped. This is useful when you need only to run action driven side effect in rocketjump environment.\r\n\r\n## api *(function)*\r\nThis is the side effect, the asynchronous task incapsulated in this rocketjump instance. The function passed to this key must conform the following signature\r\n\r\n```code\r\nlang: js\r\n---\r\n(params: any) => Promise\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe params argument will contain the first argument passed to the generated `load` action.\r\n\r\nIt is important that this function returns a Promise that resolves on valid data and rejects in case any error occurs. This allows the saga to launch the task and observe the outcome, reacting properly to eventual errors."}});
